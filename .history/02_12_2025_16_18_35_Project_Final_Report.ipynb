    "### Background\n",
    "Understanding how players engage with games and related services has become an important area of research in both computer science and interactive AI systems. Modern game environments provide rich, complex worlds where players make decisions, communicate, and interact with their surroundings. These environments are increasingly used as testbeds for developing artificial intelligence systems that can understand speech, follow instructions, and act autonomously."
