    "### Background\n",
    "Understanding how players engage with games and related services has become an important area of research in both computer science and interactive AI systems. Modern game environments provide rich, complex worlds where players make decisions, communicate, and interact with their surroundings. These environments are increasingly used as testbeds for developing artificial intelligence systems that can understand speech, follow instructions, and act autonomously."

    "The `players_data` dataset contains 196 observations and 7 variables describing player demographics, in-game behavior, and subscription status to a game-related newsletter. The data was collected by a research group in Computer Science at UBC through the PLAICraft Minecraft server, which automatically records player actions and attributes as participants navigate through the world.\n",

Furthermore, the formatting style of the column names are inconsistent, since `Age` is capitalized, but the rest aren't. We will be performing these changes in the data wrangling later."
